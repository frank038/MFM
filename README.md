# MFM
A file manager written in python and gtk3.
(work in progress)

Features:
- drag and drop
- copy/cut/paste (within the same program due to inexistent methods in pygtk)
- thumbnails and thumbnailers
- trash (of the home dir) with items sorted by data or name
- custom modules
- a lot of options can be enabled or disabled in the config file (cfg.py)
- some kind of customization

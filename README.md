Features:

- copy/cut/paste (within the same program due to inexistent methods in pygtk3);
- thumbnails and thumbnailers (require PIL for images, pdftocairo for pdf files and ffmpegthumbnailer for video files), 7z for extracting archives (also with password); more can be added for supporting almost all kind of files;
- trash (of the home dir) with items sorted by deletion data or name;
- custom modules;
- a lot of options can be enabled or disabled in the config file (cfg.py);
- some kind of customization.
